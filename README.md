# Credits:
* Most of the orbital mechanics knowledge was learned from Prussing and Conway's Orbital Mechanics textbook, and from [this](http://braeunig.us/space/index_top.htm) website.
* I am deeply indebted to [this](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/MAD/pub/ACT-RPR-MAD-2014-RevisitingLambertProblem.pdf) paper by Izzo for an algorithm for solving [Lambert's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert's_problem).
* Many of the nice UI icons are from RainbowArt's [Clean Flat Icons](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/clean-flat-icons-98117) asset pack.
* The nice 3D spheres and lines use Freya Holm√©r's [Shapes](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167) asset pack.
* Some of the double-precision versions of Unity's maths libraries came from [this](https://github.com/sldsmkd/vector3d) repo and [this](https://github.com/Darkziyu/Mathd) repo.
