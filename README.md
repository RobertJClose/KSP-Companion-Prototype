# [KSP Companion](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-148518)

This program is designed to be used alongside the game Kerbal Space Program (KSP) - a space flight simulation game with realistic orbital physics. Personally, when I played the game and used trial-and-error to find successful designs, I felt a bit like I was cheating. I wanted to play the game with the same stakes as a real space agency. You have to know before launch that your rocket is big enough, but you can't just waste resources when it comes to expensive rocketry. The goal is that it should be possible for a player to launch a mission with full confidence that the spacecraft they've built will be able to complete all the mission objectives - without unnecessary waste. This first prototype allows for the planning of a basic mission around the game's home planet Kerbin, and has all the core mechanisms needed for a final mission design tool.

## For Employers
This project has been significantly larger in scale and complexity compared to my previous coding experiences; I estimate I used 460 A5 notebook pages from the start to v1.0.0. This project involved many firsts for me, such as using Git as source control, data serialisation for saving and loading, and unit testing. Consequently this project taught me several valuable lessons in software design and engineering. Before writing any code at all I had to spend time thinking about what the user experience would be, and so how the program would be structured. I looked into different software design tools such as UML to help me make sense of what the goals of the program were, and how they could be achieved. \
This process also inspired me to read "A Philosophy Of Software Design" by Ousterhout for some guidance and a framework to assess the choices I made in the design. Even though I knew I would be the sole developer, I felt that it would be best if I coded this project as though other developers could come along and have to build on top of my work without prior experience in orbital mechanics or my code.

### The Highlights
From the start it was clear that some classes ([Orbit](https://github.com/RobertJClose/KSP-Companion-Prototype/blob/921940345136123d4c88bd0b5804d151334a8ea3/Assets/KSP%20Companion/Scripts/Orbital%20Stuff/Orbit.cs), [Angled](https://github.com/RobertJClose/KSP-Companion-Prototype/blob/921940345136123d4c88bd0b5804d151334a8ea3/Assets/KSP%20Companion/Scripts/Utilities/Angled.cs)) would be more important to the program's operation than others, and so I made sure I had a deliberate mindset when building those classes. \
For example, the [Orbit](https://github.com/RobertJClose/KSP-Companion-Prototype/blob/921940345136123d4c88bd0b5804d151334a8ea3/Assets/KSP%20Companion/Scripts/Orbital%20Stuff/Orbit.cs) class was built to represent an object in an orbit around a gravitational body. I put a lot of effort into making this class [well tested](https://github.com/RobertJClose/KSP-Companion-Prototype/blob/921940345136123d4c88bd0b5804d151334a8ea3/Assets/Tests/Editor%20Tests/Orbit%20Tests/OrbitTests.cs), well documented, and made with clear and descriptive identifiers throughout. The goal was to minimise the cognitive-load needed for a new developer to use the class, while still providing an easy to use interface for external modules to use. \
Ideally many more classes in the program would have received a similar level of attention, but I was cautious to apply such focus to aspects I knew were likely to evolve dramatically, and I thought it best for my learning to practise applying good design principles to a small and manageable area, to start a good habit to take forward to later projects.

### Things I'd Do Differently
An aspect of the program that really needs a re-do is the MissionTimeline class and the related TimelineStep class hierarchy. 
The MissionTimeline class contains a list of TimelineStep objects that represent the steps needed to achieve the mission. This class is important, but it ended up with several issues. For brevity, the fundamental problem is that the MissionTimeline class represents several different abstractions - it's a mix of UI work and various data management tasks all at once. It evolved this way due to needs of the program being met with quick ad-hoc solutions at times, and MissionTimeline's central role drew those solutions towards it. I was aware of the growing problem, particularly as my understanding of data structures deepened considerably since the first version of this class. I decided it was tolerable for the prototype, but it is something worthy of deliberate design in the future. \
Despite the issues, I'm glad for the experience of having to work with this class and its problems for the sake of understanding acronyms like SOLID and the need for what Ousterhout calls 'strategic programming'.

### Conclusion
The completion of this project demonstrated through experience some software engineering principles that I have read about in books and articles around the web. For example, I found that a small misalignment between the interface of a class and the abstraction the class is meant to represent could lead to unnecessarily complex problems arising in other modules when they try to use the class. \
I discovered the joy of proper testing during this project - this is something I found a bit of a chore when I first explored it but by the end I loved the confidence that my testing provided. I could make similar remarks on the writing of comments - by the end I enjoyed the experience of knowing my work in documenting effectively would pay off later when working with the code again later. \
Finally, this project was also an opportunity to practise skills beyond just coding. Knowing how important source control is I focused on writing good commits with helpful messages, and tried to use branches and issues effectively. 


I'd be happy to discuss this project in more detail, and I'm excited to further develop my software development skills in a professional collaborative environment.
